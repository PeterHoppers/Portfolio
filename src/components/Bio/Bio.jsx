                <p><b>Hello and welcome to my portfolio!</b></p>
                <p>I am a game programmer with cross-disciplinary experience in software development, game design, and user experience design. I learned game design while in college before being hired in web development, where I gained front-end programming and UX skills. These skills leveraged an opportunity to work in VR, allowing me to combine my experience with games in a more business setting.</p>   
                <p>After five years of professional programming experience, I am returning to my main passion of video games. I recently released a VR game for the Oculus Quest.</p>
                <p>Below are my projects organized into different focuses. Feel free to click on one and explore the projects I have been a part of to learn more about the work I have done.</p>
