                <p>I am a programmer with cross-disciplinary experience in software development, game design, and user experience design. I learned game design while in college before being hired in web development, where I gained front-end programming and UX skills. These skills leveraged an opportunity to work in VR, allowing me to combine my experience with games in a more business setting.</p>   
                <p>After five years of professional programming experience, I returned to my first passion of video games to use those skills learned. In this time, I have independently programming both VR games and web games.</p>
